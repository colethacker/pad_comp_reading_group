### Random Responding
Researchers guilty of assuming respondents exclusively use unbiased retrieval strategies when responding to questionnaires or tests, so many answer in different values due to internal changes, but want to get the to the way a respondent answers that is most unbiased.

Participants with lower motivation to perform their best increase odds of type II errors, so failing to reject the null hypothesis when there is in fact a significant result. 

Malingering - Falsify and exaggerate answers to look weaker, or more symptomatic, i.e. playing up being sick
Dissimulation - Falsify to appear worse OR better
Social Desirability - conform to social norms to look good to the examiner

Response can be random due to fatigue or lack of motivation

#### How to detect random responding?
Have one or more choices that are obviously illegitimate!
Can also identify responding by patterns then group them together to identify individuals who deviate from an expected pattern of responding

Rasch measurement produces indices of particular interest to response sets and random responding, infit/outfit both of which measure SSR

### Dichotomization

Splitting individuals measured on continuous scale into two sub groups, often via median split. Artificial subgroups based on some arbitrary sensor data.

Imagine clustering some data and drawing some arbitrary plane through the data and claiming those are two distinct groups, doesn't make sense and reduces statistical power when examining groups.

Dichotomization to normalize bad idea just do transformation or deal with outliers.

### Special Challenge of Cleaning Repeated Measures Data
**Treat all time points equally.** That is essentially the long and short of it. 
Repeated measures have closely correlated data in order to impute reasonable scores.
