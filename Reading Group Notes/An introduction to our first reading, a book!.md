Whether you're a startup founder tracking user behavior, a UX designer conducting surveys, or an analyst making business decisions, or a researcher you're working with messy human data. Osborne's book, while rooted in social science research, offers valuable insights for anyone trying to make sense of real-world data.

The book debunks 10 common myths about data cleaning through practical examples. We'll learn about:

- Handling missing data strategically rather than dropping it
- Applying statistical methods that account for data imperfections
- Designing surveys that minimize data quality issues from the start
- Documenting your data cleaning process for transparency and reproducibility

An interesting point of the this book is the iterative approach to data, which evolved from the experience of the author as a quantitative social scientist. While written for social scientists, this approach is mirrored in modern software development. For example:

- Startup teams can apply these methods to better understand user feedback cycles for their MVP
- UX designers can create more reliable user research processes
- Business analysts can better insights

We'll explore these concepts through two practical/industry lenses, since the book covers the research perspective:

1. A startup data scientist/engineer working to improve product-market fit
2. A business analyst making data-driven recommendations in marketing, finance, or venture capital

To engage with the book, think about in your own practice or industry how these tools and methods might work! 

There are exercises in the book at the end of each chapter but the links to the datasets are all dead.
