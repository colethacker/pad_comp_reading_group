Hello and welcome!

In this group we're going to read various material related to what PadComputing is all about. Here is a blurb form padcomp.org itself:
### From padcomputing.com, About Us
"""
The People and Data-centric Computing Research Group ("PadComp") at Simon Fraser University [Computing Science](https://www.sfu.ca/computing.html) conducts research at the intersection of human-computer interaction and machine learning. Our research projects generally investigate questions related to the people and data that fuel powerful "artificial intelligence" technologies.

Each data record upstream of an AI system was created with the involvement of a person (and more often than not, a group of people), so many "data-centred" projects involve people and many "human-centred" projects involve data. Our work seeks to understand these relationships and empower people to control how their data is used, and ultimately, ensure that AI is used responsibly.

#### Well, what does that mean for what we'll be reading for this group?

You can suggest any material that connects to PadComp's mission described above. Just provide a brief explanation of how it relates.

For myself, here is how I think about what we can read about:

We'll study both fundamental concepts and recent breakthroughs in machine learning and AI. Understanding the basics is crucial - as Newton (or St. Bernard) said, "If I have seen further, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants." After all, an expert is a master of the basics.

The next thing is how ML and AI and the interactions with people, HCI, Human Centred AI, responsible AI, ethical AI and so on. This is more in line with the purpose of the lab and should be self-evident.

The less obvious thing that I think would be useful to talk and learn about, is people. We think about the very definition of ethics, responsibility and society. We can explore ethics, responsibility, and society through philosophy and other social sciences. For example, media theory can help us understand bias in AI systems.

#### Format

Each session I'm aiming for three parts:

1. Presentation: A member presents notes or a summary of the reading, practicing their presentation skills and leading the discussion.
2. Group Discussion: We'll have a facilitated discussion where everyone can share their thoughts.
3. Open Floor: Members can present projects, blogs, articles, or other materials. For longer pieces, consider requesting a slot in the first section. Think of this as pitching interesting content to the group.

#### I'm not a researcher, why should I read research papers?
Allow me to present an example as to why you should: as a startup engineer, you need to build products with competitive advantages - unique features your competitors can't easily copy. Research papers reveal state-of-the-art technologies and techniques that can give your product an edge.

Beyond research papers, you'll often encounter "n-pagers" in your work - concise technical documents that outline complex decisions or strategies. These documents read much like academic papers. By practicing with research papers now, you'll develop the vital skill of quickly understanding and synthesizing complex technical information.
